Yoti Doc Scan can be integrated in the following ways:

- Scenario 1: Doc scan
- Scenario 2: Doc Scan + Liveness
- Scenario 3: Doc Scan + Liveness + App option. 

Before your customers start the Doc Scan process, it’s important they know what to expect in the next steps. Customers will need to be informed why each step is necessary and reassurance that any personal information they add is for verification purposes only.

## Scenario 1: Doc Scan

Customers use the Doc Scan solution to share ID documents (like a passport or driving license) or non-ID documents (like a utility bill) with your business. 

## Scenario 2: Doc Scan + Liveness

Customers use the Doc Scan service to share ID documents or non-ID documents with your business.

The liveness process requires them to take a scan of their face in an anti-spoofing liveness test. This is an automated process to make sure that it is a real person proving their identity and not a bot. This scan will be matched to the photo on their ID document to also ensure they are the owner of the ID document.

## Scenario 3: Doc Scan + Liveness + App option

You can also give users the option to verify their identity using the free Yoti app. This will also require the user to add an ID document and verify they’re a real person with a liveness test, but this will then create a reusable ID they can use at thousands of other websites and stores.
