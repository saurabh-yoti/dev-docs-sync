## Retrieving results from a MyGo Pro

When you create a new experiment in the MyGo Pro software, you will be shown a new **Experiment Name**. By default this is called "New experiment".

Please replace this with the **batch number** that was generated when you finished the virtual plate.

{% html %}
<div class="alert-BYS">
   <div class="alert-title" id="BYS">
      Warning
   </div>
   <div class="alert-text" >
      This generated batch number is unique to a particular set of customer samples and their personal details. Ensure that you enter the correct batch number into this field for a test plate. Entering the wrong number could mean sending results to the wrong customers. Please double check this number when running tests using a MyGo Pro machine.
