When you have reliable information that the customer details are incorrect (e.g., a typo in an email) you will be able to edit these details from the **Held results** and the **Reporting** area. Editing customer details is only available when the customer chose to identify themselves via webform during the Collection flow.

You must have **Held results** and/or **Reporting** permissions to be able to edit patient details in the Yoti Testing Platform.

## 1. Edit customer details via Held Results

You can edit the customer details by: 

1. clicking the three dots at the end of that customer's row and selecting the **Edit details** option; or
2. clicking the **Update customer details** button when you are seeing the customers details.

Changing customer details will not send the results to the customer. In order to send the results to that customer you will still need to select the **Send test result** option.
