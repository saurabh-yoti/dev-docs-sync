Depending on the type of test being used, there is usually a length of time that a collected sample can be safely processed before the test is deemed to be expired. Yoti Testing Platform has a configurable expiry time for each available test kit. For more information on test expiry details for your chosen test, please see the **Sample collection kits** section.

Expiry times for sample collection kits are defined by medical professionals and manufacturers of the test, and should not be altered.   <div class="alert-links">

At the end of expiration, the Yoti Testing Platform automatically sends an inconclusive result to the customer. The customer will be advised to contact the organisation that issued the result, and schedule an appointment to be re-tested.

Remember to upload processed batch files a soon as possible so that:

1. Customers receive their test result as quickly as possible.
2. Batch files are not left to expire, causing an increase in retesting.
