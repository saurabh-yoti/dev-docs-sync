## What data is being asked for and why?

This depends on how a customer chooses to receive their test result. The table below lists what data is being captured by default for each option and why.

### Using the Yoti app

{% table %}
| Attribute | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Facial photo | This is collected so that a customer can show their COVID-19 status alongside a photo of themselves in their Yoti app. | 
| Remember Me ID | This is a unique identifier that enables a test sample to be linked to a customer’s Yoti app on their phone. | 
{% /table %}

### Submitting an online form

{% table %}
| Attribute | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Full Name | This is collected so that a result can clearly show who was linked to that test. | 
| Verified with ID? | We record whether or not the collector has verified the **Full Name** by asking to see a form of official ID document. | 
| Email address | This is the email address that the test result email is sent to. | 
{% /table %}

### Filling in a business owned paper-based form

These requested details are not added to the Yoti Testing Platform and so we do not know what data will and won’t be requested. You should only ask for the minimum data necessary and have a justifiable reason for asking for each data item.

### Symptom questionnaire

This supplementary questionnaire enables a collector to record any symptoms that the customer wishes to disclose. This information does not affect the outcome of a customer’s test. 

The display of this questionnaire is optional and can be configured in **Data Collection**, under **Settings**. When displayed by your organisation, a customer has the choice to skip it.

{% table %}
| Information | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Symptoms | To capture what symptoms customers think they have at the point of taking a test. A symptom analysis report can provide further insight on regional and organisational test results. | 
| Temperature in ºC | If the business desires, the customer's temperature can be taken and recorded by the collector in addition to the swab test. | 
{% /table %}

### What your organisation is doing with this data

In many jurisdictions, individuals must by law be told what will happen to their personal data, how long it will be stored for, who it will be shared with, how to contact your organisation and other information. Your organisation should provide this information to the customer at or before the data collection. This could be through a privacy notice or by providing specific information at the data collection point.
