**1.** Customer is welcomed by a collector and introduced to the service.

**2.** The customer is given three options to provide the personal information required to be tested.

**3.** If the customer chooses Yoti:

a. The customer is shown a Yoti QR code, which they scan using their Yoti app.

b. The customer shares their details using the Yoti app.

**4.** If the customer chooses to provide their details using an online form:

a. The customer is asked for the required information and the collector enters this into an online form.

b. The customer is shown a summary of their details to confirm they are correct.

**5.** If the customer chooses to provide their details using a paper form:

a. The customer is asked for the required information that the collector writes into a paper-based form.

**6.** For customers who choose the Yoti app or the online form, the collector can ask for symptom information (this step is optional).

**7.** The collector then collects a sample from the customer and secures it safely in the sample collection kit bag.

**8.** The collector informs the customer how they will receive their result:

a. Yoti: as a notification from their Yoti app, which will open the Yoti app to show their result.

b. Online form (email): from an automated email containing their test result.

c. Online form (phone number): a testing representative will tell them their test result over the phone.

d. Paper based form: the organisation will contact the customer.

**9.** After the test has been processed, the customer receives their result.

**10.** If the test is:

a. Negative - the organisation can choose to advise on when the customer must return to be tested again, if necessary.

b. Positive - the customer will be asked to contact the organisation who issued the test result.

c. Inconclusive - the customer will be asked to contact the organisation who issued the test result to schedule a retest.
