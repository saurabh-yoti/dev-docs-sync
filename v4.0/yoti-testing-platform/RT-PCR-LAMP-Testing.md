The second stage is to process the collected sample. The sample collection tube can be immediately processed on site, or it can be transported to a test centre or laboratory for testing in one of the tests supported by the Yoti Testing Platform. You must have the **Prepare test plates** permission to be able to add customer samples to your testing plates in the Yoti Testing Platform. 

As an alternative, you may choose to have the samples analysed by an independent test centre or laboratory. In this case the testing process happens externally to the Yoti Testing Platform. 

Go to **Step 1** for _Tests supported by the Yoti Testing Platform_. 

Go to **Step 9** for _Tests performed by independent test centre or laboratory_.

## 1. Start a testing session

Open your web browser and go to [**https://frankd.yoti.com/iam/login**](https://frankd.yoti.com/iam/login)

It is recommended that you open this on the same device that’s running the test machine software. Use your Yoti app or email address and password to log in. Note: It is always more secure to log in using your Yoti app.

From the dashboard, select **Start testing** to begin a testing session.

## 2. Select machine type

Select the machine you are using for this testing session. If you don't see your machine listed here, please contact your administrator.

## 3. Select a virtual well

Select a **well** on the virtual well plate. Your plate may look different to the one shown below, plate designs match the testing machine you are using.

Well plates can cater for any number of well configurations, and is dependant on the size of the machine being used.

For this test example, the last two wells on each row are for a ‘negative’ and a ‘positive’ control sample, which help ensure validity of the test result. These control wells are coloured grey and cannot be allocated to any customer sample. Your test machine may position their control sample in different wells, but they will look the same as shown below.

Transfer 0.05 ml of buffer solution from the **control buffer tube** into each of the **control tubes** on the strip well, using a separate pipette for each control tube.

## 3. Scan QR code on test bag

Use the device’s camera to scan the QR code on the test bag. These bags do not have to be selected in a specific order.

{% /image %}

## 4. Confirm transfer

Once the transfer is complete, and the reaction tube lid is closed, select **Confirm**. The sample from the bag that was scanned is now in the correctly positioned testing tube.

{% /image %}

## 5. Filling virtual wells

The selected well turns green on the virtual well display. This well cannot be selected again during this test batch. Repeat the well location assignment and solution transfer process for further sample tubes until the rest of the virtual wells are filled or you have no more tests to add.

{% /image %}

## 6. Request batch number

Select **Start machine test** in the bottom right corner of the screen. This finalises this well plate assignment and generates a unique batch number for this virtual well plate to uniquely identify it. The virtual well plate securely contains the details of all the samples and customers.

{% /image %}

## 7. Run machine test

Now place your samples into your machine and run your machine.

Please see **Test machines** for how to set up and run your chosen test in your chosen test machine; which in turn will be allocated your batch number.

{% /image %}

## 8. Export test results

Export the results file of the completed test from your chosen test machine software and save the file locally on your device. The name of the file should be the batch number for that plate. Exit the testing session and select **Upload test results** from the dashboard. 

You must have the **Run machine and upload results** permission to be able to upload result files from your testing machine software to the Yoti Testing Platform.

{% /image %}

Go to **Step 10**.

## 9. Tests performed by independent test centre or laboratory

Collect the results file of the completed test from the independent test centre or laboratory and save the file locally on your device. This file should follow this [template](https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/External-lab-results-template.csv) and the name of the file should be alphanumerical. Select **Upload test results** from the dashboard.

You must have the **Run machine and upload results** permission to be able to upload result files from your testing machine software to the Yoti Testing Platform.

## 10. Upload test result

Select the test results file and select **Upload**.

## 11. Results sent

Once the file has been uploaded,

- Results will appear in the results data for your organisation.
- Yoti and online form customers will automatically receive their test result.
- If the held results feature is set to ON, results are sent to the held results area before customers can receive their test result.
