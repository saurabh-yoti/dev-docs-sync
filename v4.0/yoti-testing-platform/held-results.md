You can control when you want to issue test results to your customers. A held results page in Admin helps you manage and manually take actions on held results. In order for a user to log in and access the held results area, they must be given access. Access is obtained by being given the **Held results** permission to the user’s account in user management.
You must have the **Settings** and **Held results** permissions to be able to set up and use the held results feature in the Yoti Testing Platform.

## Setting up held results

1. Go to **Admin** and then select **Settings.**
2. Select **Results** tab.

Under the results tab, there are two options available for issuing results:

## Send all results automatically

By default, customers who have linked their test to their Yoti app or an email address, will automatically receive their test result, regardless of the result outcome.

## Hold results for review

Customers who have been tested will not automatically receive their result, enabling you to divulge a customer’s result at a more appropriate time. You can choose which result outcomes you would like to hold for review:

- Hold negative results
- Hold positive results
- Hold inconclusive results

Please note that expiry timelines still apply even if you choose to hold results. A held result is automatically sent an inconclusive result if held for longer than the expiry time defined by your chosen sample collection kit.

The quicker you act on this, the less time your customers will need to wait to receive their test result.

Customers that are held for more than the defined expiry duration will automatically receive an inconclusive test result, and will be required to return and be tested again.

Expired test results are automatically removed from the held results table.

## Managing held results

By activating held results, a new page appears in the global navigation menu in the Admin area.

1. Go to **Admin** and then select **Held results.**
2. This is where you will see a list of held results in a table.
3. Click on the  **Send** icon for a held result. This will open a modal showing additional details on this test result. 
4. This is where you can find the customer’s available contact details. You can also copy the email address to your clipboard.
5. To send the result to the customer, select **Send result**. You will be asked to confirm this action because it will automatically send this test result to a Yoti app or online form customer.
6. To go back to the table, select **Cancel**.
