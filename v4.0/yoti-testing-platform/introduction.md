The process of collecting samples, analysing results and notifying customers can involve the following:

## Yoti Testing Platform

The tool used to link a test sample to a customer, and then issue the result of the test to that customer. It is accessible via a web browser, across a multitude of device types.

## Sample collection kit

The testing kit used to collect a test sample from a customer. Please see **Sample collection kits** for more information on your chosen testing kit.

## Test machines

Certain test types require a machine to process the sample to determine a negative, positive or inconclusive test result. Please see **Test machines** for more information and instructions.

## Collector’s device

To obtain a customer's information, collectors can use a different device to that of the laptop or desktop computer that is connected to the test machine. This provides a contactless experience for all parties. An online form can be used for customers not using the Yoti app – these customers will receive an email containing their test result.

## Customer’s smartphone

A customer can use their smartphone to link their Yoti account to their test. They will receive their test result in their Yoti app.

## Overview of RT-PCR & RT-LAMP process

Test types such as FRANKD, require a machine to process the collected sample. Below is an overview of the steps required to collect, test and issue a test result to a customer.

1. The collector links a customer to a testing bag via Yoti or email.
2. The sample is collected from the customer.
3. The customer can choose to submit a symptom questionnaire.
4. A technician assigns the customer sample to digital well, linking the customer to the real well in the testing plate.
5. A technician places the testing plate to the machine and runs the test.
6. Results are then uploaded to the Yoti Testing Platform and are automatically sent to customers. 
7. The customer receives their test result in their Yoti app or via email.

## Overview of Lateral Flow Test process

Lateral Flow Tests (LFT) are simple devices intended to detect the presence of a target substance in a liquid sample without the need for a test machine or other device. Below is an overview of the steps required to collect, test and issue a test result to a customer using a LFT.

1. The collector links a customer to a testing bag via Yoti or email.
2. The sample is collected from the customer.
3. The customer can choose to submit a symptom questionnaire.
4. The technician scans the test, allocating the customer to a number. Numbered cards on the screen show a countdown timer for each test.
5. The technician is notified to check for a result at the optimum time for each test.
6. The result is submitted to Yoti Testing Platform and is sent to the customer.
7. The customer receives their test result in their Yoti app or via email.
