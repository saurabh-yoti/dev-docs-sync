Users in the Yoti Testing Platform can be managed manually via user management. This page helps you manage these users manually. In order for a user to log in and access the Yoti Testing Platform, they must be given access. Access is obtained by being invited to the application by a Yoti Testing Platform administrator. 

You must have the **Settings** and **User Management** permission to be able to manage users in the Yoti Testing Platform.

After the user is created, you‚Äôll be brought to a screen where you can view the user in the users table. The user will receive an invitation email that directs them to the create account screen in the Yoti Testing Platform. They can use their Yoti app or create a password to get access to the application.

## Edit a user

Modifying user information and permissions is easy in User Management. Please note that you won‚Äôt be able to edit a user‚Äôs email address as this is associated with testing and cannot be changed.

1. Select **Admin** and then **User Management.**
2. Find the user in the user list or search using their full email address.
3. Click the ‚úèÔ∏è edit icon. 
4. Make your changes and click **Update user** to finish.

## Change a password

Users can easily change their own password via the login screen by selecting **Forgot password.** This will allow a user to submit their email address, which will send a reset password email.

We strongly recommend that all users log in using their Yoti app. This ensures that your users utilise the highest safety and security standards Yoti has to offer.

## Disabling a user

You can disable a user‚Äôs account to prevent them from using the Yoti Testing Platform.

1. Select **Admin** and then **User Management.**
2. Find the user in the user list or search using their full email address.
3. Click the üö´ **Remove all permissions** icon found under the Permissions column.

---

## Delete a User

If you have a user that no longer needs access to the Yoti Testing Platform, we recommend that you disable their account rather than delete them. Disabling a user's account will prevent the account from being used, but it will also preserve that user's history of activity.

1. Select **Admin** and then **User Management.**
2. Find the user in the user list or search using their full email address.
3. Click the ‚úèÔ∏è edit icon.
4. Select **Delete user** button.

All tests associated with a deleted user will no longer show who did the collecting/testing, and will instead show an anonymous user ID number.

Deleted users can still log in, after which they will be informed that their access has been removed.

All this ensures that test data is not affected by actions made in user management.

### Permissions

You won't want every user in your team to have the same level of access to the Yoti Testing Platform. For example, you may want to restrict who can administer the Yoti Testing Platform, or prevent users from uploading test results. In this step, you will learn about the different permissions in the Yoti Testing Platform and set permissions for each of your users.

You can set the following permissions for each user:

{% table %}
| Access Role | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Customer data | A user can upload a csv with customer data that have pre-registered to be tested. | 
| Collect samples | A user can collect a test sample and capture personal information to link a customer to their sample. | 
| Prepare test plates | A user can allocate test samples to wells in a testing plate, in preparation for testing the samples in a machine. | 
| Run machine and upload results | A user can take an exported data file from a test machine and upload it to the Yoti Testing Platform for processing. | 
| Reporting | A user can view all test data and download test data currently stored on Yoti‚Äôs secure servers. | 
| Held results | A user has access to the held results area, where they can manage customer test results currently on hold for review. | 
| User management | A user can manage all user accounts and permissions in the Yoti Testing Platform. _(This should only be given to someone who acts as an administrator for your Yoti Testing Platform.)_ | 
| Settings | A user can access all the configuration settings for the application. (_This should only be given to someone who acts as an administrator for your Yoti Testing Platform.)_ |
