If you leave a session in progress, the Yoti Testing Platform saves tests that you have allocated in your session. This applies to RT-PCR/LAMP tests allocated to a testing plate and LFT test cards. This is so that you can return to those incomplete tests at a later time where necessary.

## Notifying you of incomplete plates

When you start a new testing session that uses testing plates, you will be notified if you have an incomplete test plate:

{% /image %}

Select **Continue incomplete plate** to load the plate into your testing session.

Select **Start a new plate** if you want to ignore the incomplete plate and start a new testing session. The incomplete plate remains until you start a new testing session, where you will see this message again.

## Notifying you of incomplete LFT cards

When you start a new LFT testing session, you will be notified if you have an incomplete session:

{% /image %}

Select **Continue incomplete cards** to load the incomplete LFT cards into your testing session.

Select **Start a new card session** if you want to ignore the incomplete LFT cards and start a new testing session. The incomplete LFT cards remain until you start a new testing session, where you will see this message again.

If you have access to multiple testing devices, they will show you if there is a session in progress.
