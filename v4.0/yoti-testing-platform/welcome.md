The intended purpose of the Yoti Testing Platform (YTP) software is to record, analyse and report data related to COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and lateral flow testing. We consider it suitable for use by organisations, governments and authorities worldwide.

Learning to use this software is easy, but we recommend that you become familiar with the terms, concepts and methodologies presented in our COVID-19 Primer. You should review this document thoroughly before you make use of the software.
