The first stage is to collect a sample from the person being tested. The following steps are performed by a person collecting test samples. This can be done using any **compatible device** and at any location.
You must have the **Collect samples** permission to be able to collect customer samples in the Yoti Testing Platform.

## 1. Log into the Yoti Testing Platform on your device

Open your web browser and go to [**https://frankd.yoti.com/iam/login**](https://frankd.yoti.com/iam/login). Use your Yoti app or email address and password to log in. If you don’t yet have access, please contact Yoti at [**sdksupport@yoti.com**](mailto:sdksupport@yoti.com).

Note:  It is always more secure to log in using your Yoti app.

## 2. Start collection session

From the dashboard, select **Start collecting** to start your collection session.

A session enables you to capture customer test samples one at a time. You can collect as many test samples as you want during your session.

## 3. Scan the QR code on the test bag

Scan the QR code on the front of the sample collection bag to link the bag to the Yoti Testing Platform. Please select **Allow** when the Yoti Testing Platform asks permission to access your device’s camera.

## 4. Options for issuing result

The customer can choose how they would like their test result sent to them. They can:

- issue it to their Yoti app on their phone;
- receive it by email; or
- have the testing organisation contact them. 

Go to **Step 5** for _Yoti app._

Go to **Step 6** for _Submit online form_ (email).

Go to **Step 10** for _Fill in paper form_ (business contact).

## 5. Use Yoti app

For results to be delivered to the Yoti app, select **Use Yoti app** and ask the customer to scan the on-screen Yoti QR code. This will automatically link the sample bag and the customer Yoti profile. 

Go to **Step 8** to continue.

## 6. Submit online form

For results to be delivered via email, select **Online form**. You will need to submit an online form with some customer details. Enter the customer’s **full name, email address,** plus any additional details requested by your organisation.

Go to **Step 7** to continue.

{% /image %}

## 7. Confirm online form details (Email)

A summary of the customer details is presented in a larger text size. Please show this screen to the customer from a safe distance and ask them to confirm that these details are correct. If there is a mistake, select **No, make changes** to return to the online form.

Go to **Step 8** to continue.

{% /image %}

## 8.  Symptom questionnaire

If a customer has chosen **Yoti app** or **Online form**, and the **Symptom questionnaire** is enabled, you will be asked to complete a symptom questionnaire on behalf of the customer. This does not affect the customer’s test result and can be skipped.

Go to **Step 9** to continue.

{% /image %}

## 9. Collect sample (Yoti / Online form)

Proceed to collect a test sample from the customer. Confirm the collection once this process is completed. 

Please refer to your chosen **Sample collection kit** to find out how to collect a sample successfully.

There is also the option to cancel the collection if a problem arises, in which case you will need to link a new bag to the customer’s Yoti profile and collect another sample. 

Linking a new bag to a Yoti or online form will replace any previously linked test bag to this customer.

Go to **Step 11** to continue.

## 10. Filling in a paper form

For results delivered outside of the Yoti Testing Platform, select **Paper form**. Proceed to collect a test sample from the customer using the swab. 

Please refer to your chosen **Sample collection kit** to find out how to collect a sample successfully.

Select **Confirm collection** once this process is completed and place the paper form in the test bag.

There is also the option to cancel the collection if a problem arises, in which case you will need to scan a new bag for the customer and collect another sample. 

Go to **Step 11** to continue.

## 11. Collection complete

The customer’s test sample has been successfully collected and linked. You are then taken to **Step 3** to scan the QR code on the front of the next test bag to be used.

If you are finished with your collecting session, select **Exit** in the top right corner of the screen.
