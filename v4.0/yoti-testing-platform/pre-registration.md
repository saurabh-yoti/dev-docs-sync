In order to expedite the Collection flow, you may choose to allow your customer to pre-register. You can configure this option from **Data Collection** in **Settings.**

If this option is enabled, you will be able to upload your customer's details via a csv file in the **Customer data** tab in **Admin**. You must have the **Customer data** permission to be able to access the **Customer data** area.

The csv should contain all the data you require from your customers, as per the [template](https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/Pre-registration-template.csv) displayed under. Once the customer has been tested, their details will be removed from the database where they were stored.
