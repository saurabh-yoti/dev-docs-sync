## Access management platform

We have built a node (or marketplace app) for ForgeRock BackStage. This means that companies that have integrated with ForgeRock can simply integrate the Yoti node, which is already compatible with ForgeRock Access Manager. Now the many organisations that use ForgeRock can quickly integrate with Yoti, using it to sign in to their platforms or verify their users.
