After you have created an organisation with us please [contact us](mailto:sdksupport@yoti.com) for API keys including your organisation name. We aim to get you api keys within 1-2 working days.

Yoti will provide:

- API Key
- SDK ID

The overview below sets out the entities and data flows involved.

## Technical overview of the Yoti Age architecture

This section describes the API interactions for a web and mobile web integration. Data is exchanged securely between the relying party (your backend), Yoti and the client (the end userâ€™s browser or mobile device).

{% /image %}

A **session** represents one end-to-end request of the age verification service. The session identifier is in the create session request's response. Every time a user elects a method of age verification on your relying business app or website, you will need to create a session with Yoti to perform the checks.

Once the Yoti Client has launched it will take the end user through the appropriate age capture flow. Once this flow is completed the end user is redirected back to the relying business client so that they may continue their journey. These redirects are defined when generating the session.

The session can be retrieved using the session ID. The response from this endpoint contains information on the age of the user, result and method.

## The user flow

The user will be asked to prove their age and is taken through the Yoti verification steps where they will be presented with the options you have selected. You will then need to redirect them to a success or error URL, alternatively you can listen to post messaging from the iframe.

## Using Yoti responsibly

We pride ourselves on how we handle our users' data. We use tech for good and enable users to securely prove their identity or age, always being transparent about what happens to their details.

- Be transparent about why you're collecting data and only use this data for those reasons.
- Only collect the information you actually need. Data minimisation is one of the main benefits of Yoti, so people don't have to provide more information than is actually necessary.
- Make sure any information you export to your own systems is stored securely. Data security is at the heart of what we do and we think it should be important to every organisation.
