## Web client

The next step is to load the Yoti client SDK. 

{% html %}
<div class="alert-BYS">
   <div class="alert-title" id="BYS">
      Before you start
   </div>
   <div class="alert-text" >
     Please have a look at our best practices for a better performance of the SDK.

### How it works

The constructed URLâ€‹ (using the sessionId and session token), which loads the customised Yoti Client SDK, can be used in several ways:

- Within an iframe on your webpage
- As a link on your webpage
- As a link shared securely with a user

{% video %}
{% /video %}

In the response to your create session [request](/yoti/generating-a-session), you will have received:

- Session ID
- Session Token

These values can now be used to create a URL.

{% code %}
{% tab language="http" %}
https://api.yoti.com/idverify/v1/web/index.html?sessionID=<inputsessionID>&sessionToken=<yoursessionToken>
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

{% table %}
| URL Component | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| sessionId | The session ID from the Yoti response. | 
| sessionToken | The session token from the Yoti response. | 
{% /table %}

The example below demonstrates the use of an iframe:

{% code %}
{% tab language="markdown" %}
<iframe src="<https://api.yoti.com/idverify/v1/web/index.html?sessionID=<inputsessionID>&sessionToken=<yoursessionTokenID>" style="height:600px; width:100%; border:none;" allow="camera"></iframe>
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

Once the Yoti Client SDK has launched it will take the user through the ID document capture flow.

The Yoti Client SDK will fetch the verification session configuration that was defined on session creation. This will provide configuration for the captures to be performed, and which methods are allowed.

Having received the session configuration, the Yoti Client SDK will handle the capture of all resources necessary to process the requested tasks and checks, and submit them to the server.

Once the required resources (and their associated media) have been captured and uploaded, the end user is redirected back to the relying business client so that they may continue their journey via the success or error URLs. The tasks and checks are performed in the background, and any updates are sent to the updates URL (if subscribed) or can be found by calling the session retrieval endpoint.

## Mobile client

The mobile integration provides a native version of Yoti Doc Scan which can be integrated into your own Mobile App, as opposed to being rendered through a webpage.

The mobile integrations that we currently support are listed below for the Yoti Doc Scan integration. Please select your preferred language to continue.

- [iOS](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-ios)
- [Android](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-android)
- [React native](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native)
