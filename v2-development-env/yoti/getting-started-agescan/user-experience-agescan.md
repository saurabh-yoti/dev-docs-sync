Create optimal experiences for your customers and increase conversion by following these best practices for web and mobile integrations.

In this section, we offer tips and considerations to create a great and simple experience for your users.

**Technical:**

- Yoti only accepts JPEGâ€™s encoded as a base64 image
- Base64 body must be below 100KB (~70KB JPEG)
- The minimum face dimensions we accept is 96 x 96 pixels

**User:**

- Ensure that you are being transparent with regards to what the photo is going to be used for and make sure that it gets permanently deleted from your system once the age estimation has been performed.
- Try to ensure that you are displaying a frame for the user to place their face so that the image is successfully captured.
- Ideally you want the user front on with their full face on show and close to the camera.
- Mirroring the image to match the user's orientation will make aligning themselves easier.
