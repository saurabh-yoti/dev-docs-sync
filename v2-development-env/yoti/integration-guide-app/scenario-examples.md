### Prove identity

Customers use the free Yoti app to securely share pre-verified details with your business. Customers only need to verify themselves once using the app.

It is recommended that the vertical order of the structure above is maintained. For desktop users where horizontal space exists, we recommend separating **How To** from other sections as shown below:
