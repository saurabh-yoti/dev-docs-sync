## Button design guide

The Yoti button that comes with our SDKs is easy to integrate and includes built-in education that ensures a consistent design and experience. It should look like this:

{% /image %}

### Recommended labels

You should always provide context in a Yoti button, here are our best performing labels:

- Prove age with Yoti
- Verify with Yoti 
- Prove identity with Yoti
- Log in with Yoti
- Sign in with Yoti
- Register with Yoti
- Sign up with Yoti

{% /image %}

### Placement

You should display the Yoti button in a highly visible location on your website. 

If Yoti is offered with other options, ensure you make all options the same width and height for a consistent layout.

{% /image %}

## Size and shape

The Yoti button should be easily recognisable on your website. Please use the provided button design without making any visual changes.

## Set up expectations

Helping your users understand what they need to do and why will give them a better, more seamless experience.

### Use steps

We recommend using a step-by-step navigation journey so users can easily understand whats required of them. These steps can:

- Be completed in one go, or require users to return at different times
- Include online and offline actions
- Represent one-off or regularly repeated tasks
- Link to content and services outside of Yoti

You can customise content like the links in the steps and the names, but you cannot customise the design of step by step navigation.

We recommend you use the following:

{% image url="https://image-archive.developerhub.io/image/upload/23575/zu4pozjs4m80ydvrcorj/1575300425.jpg" caption="Example of expectations" mode="responsive" height="860" width="1682" %}
{% /image %}

### Time expectations

Donâ€™t be too specific about how long the process can take. Give generic time estimations instead.

{% image url="https://image-archive.developerhub.io/image/upload/23575/tiowlniau2rl8oey5u4k/1575300483.jpg" caption="Time expectations" mode="600" height="538" width="1106" %}
{% /image %}

### In context messaging

Including messaging next to your button can add more context and clarity on what is going to happen next and the actions the button will trigger.

Some examples:

{% image url="https://image-archive.developerhub.io/image/upload/23575/mulhnyaeao9tfgzeftw7/1575300556.jpg" caption="Context descriptions" mode="600" height="172" width="972" %}
{% /image %}

### Learn more link

This provides users with the extra information they might need. There should be a link wherever the Yoti button is. It should direct users to:

**[https://www.yoti.com](https://www.yoti.com)**
