## Yoti Hub access

Once your organisation has been created, our onboarding team will aim to review your application within 2-3 business hours. You will be able to continue your integration while your application is under review. Get access to Yoti Hub by scanning a Yoti QR code with your Yoti app.

        Once you have logged in, your phone will display a 'connected' screen. If you leave the Yoti app, you won't be able to see receipts in Yoti Hub. This is for security purposes. Log in to your Yoti app to gain access to receipts.
