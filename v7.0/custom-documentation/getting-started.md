Yoti provides you with a simple dashboard management  tool called [Yoti Hub ](https://hub.yoti.com/login)to get you up and running with our products. The Yoti hub allows you to generate your API keys, add your billing information and more. 

Once your organisation has been created, our onboarding team will aim to review your application within **2-3 business hours**. We will send you an onboarding email you once you are verified. 

To start integrating our products you will need to:

1. Download a the Yoti app / Easy ID app.
2. Set up an account on the [Hub](https://hub.yoti.com/login-organisations) and get verified.
3. Generate API keys.

This section walks you through how to complete this. You will need to know information about your organisation, key contact details and billing details. 

If you don't have this to hand, don't worry you can return anytime to continue with your application.
