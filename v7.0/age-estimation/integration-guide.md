Once you've set up your organisation account on the [Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com/logout), youâ€™re ready to start integrating with the Age estimation and anti-spoofing API.

There is one step to follow to integrate the Age estimation and anti-spoofing API:

1. Create a request

---

## Create a request

{% badge type="info" text="NOTE" /%} This service is with a higher quality image. Please read the [](/age-verification/overview) for more details.

After completing the Yoti onboarding, you will need to complete authentication for the API by using the Yoti SDK to simplify the process. The Yoti SDKs are available via popular dependency management systems.

{% code %}
{% tab language="javascript" %}
npm install -S -E yoti
{% /tab %}
{% tab language="java" %}
// If you are using Maven, add the following dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yoti</groupId>
    <artifactId>yoti-sdk-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</dependency>

// If you are using Gradle, add the following dependency:
compile group: 'com.yoti', name: 'yoti-sdk-api', version: '3.0.0'
{% /tab %}
{% tab language="php" %}
// Get the Yoti PHP SDK library via a Composer package
composer require yoti/yoti-php-sdk
{% /tab %}
{% tab language="python" %}
pip install yoti
{% /tab %}
{% tab language="csharp" %}
// To install the Yoti NuGet package you will need to install NuGet.
// To import the latest Yoti SDK into your project, enter the following
// command from NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:

Install-Package Yoti

// For other installation methods, see https://www.nuget.org/packages/Yoti
{% /tab %}
{% tab language="go" %}
// As of version 2.4.0, modules are used. This means it's not necessary to get a copy or fetch all dependencies 
// as instructed below, as the Go toolchain will fetch them as necessary. 
// You can simply add a `require github.com/getyoti/yoti-go-sdk/v2` to go.mod.
// To download and install the Yoti SDK and its dependencies, run the following command from your terminal:

go get "github.com/getyoti/yoti-go-sdk/v3"
{% /tab %}
{% tab language="ruby" %}
gem install yoti

# The gem provides a configuration generator for Ruby on Rails:

rails generate yoti:install
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

You can create three types of requests using the API:

{% table %}
| Endpoint | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| [https://api.yoti.com/ai/v1/age](https://api.yoti.com/ai/v1/age) | Use Yoti's age estimation service. | 
| [https://api.yoti.com/ai/v1/age-antispoofing](https://api.yoti.com/ai/v1/age-antispoofing) | Use Yoti's age estimation service and the Anti-spoofing check. | 
| [https://api.yoti.com/ai/v1/antispoofing](https://api.yoti.com/ai/v1/antispoofing) | Use Yoti's anti-spoofing check as a standalone product. | 
{% /table %}

Once you have added the Yoti SDK dependency to your project, you can use it to build and send your request. See the code snippets below for examples.

{% code %}
{% tab language="javascript" %}

This endpoint will return an anti-spoofing result alongside an Age Estimation.

This JSON string must be sent in the `img` parameter in `withPayload`.

{% code %}
{% tab language="json" %}
{
    "img": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAgAAAQABAAD/2wAcHNXCKigjEaYH51Me1Zy1Za0P/Z...."

   }
}
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

If integrating into a non-browser client, we recommend contacting [clientsupport@yoti.com](mailto:clientsupport@yoti.com) for additional support.

### Terminal integrations

Optionally, additional headers may be provided to the request to allow Yoti to track error responses coming from a particular machine. This would typically be used in a non-browser client scenario, such as an ePOS terminal where each individual machine must be registered by the business.

In order to do this, the following headers should be applied:

{% table widths="187" %}
| Header | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Terminal-Id | Unique ID per machine. Mandatory for non-browser integrations. | 
| Session-Id | May be provided to demonstrate multiple attempts are from a single user transaction. | 
{% /table %}

### Example response

The response received from the API will be below:

{% code %}
{% tab language="json" %}
{
    "antispoofing": {
        "prediction": "real"
    },
    "age": {
        "age": 25.1,
        "st_dev": 3.5
    }
}
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

{% table widths="225" %}
| Response | Explained | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Prediction - real | Yoti has detected a real user. | 
| Prediction - fake | Yoti has detected a spoof attempt. | 
| Prediction - undetermined | Yoti is unable to determine if the user is real or not. | 
| Age - age | The age estimation of the user. | 
| Age - st_dev | The st_dev value is a confidence score. Yoti recommends rejecting any response with an uncertainty greater than 6.0. Typically this indicates a problem with image capture. This should **only** be treated as a quality score. | 
{% /table %}

## Requirements

The image requirements to use this service are:

{% table %}
| Condition | Requirement | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Quantity | Only one single face in the image. | 
| Image type | Yoti only accepts JPEGs (95 to 100 quality) and PNGs. Please avoid image format conversion to avoid degrading the image quality. Multiple changes will introduce quality losses in the image. | 
| Image resolution | The recommended minimum resolution is 1280 x 720px. The maximum resolution accepted is FullHD 1920 x 1080px. | 
| Colour | The image must be colour (RGB). Yoti does not accept black and white or filtered images. | 
| Size | The minimum image size is 50KB. The maximum image size is 1.5 MB. | 
{% /table %}

Thereâ€™s a tradeoff between estimation accuracy and camera quality / light conditions, false-negative errors such as face not detected or spoofing attempt detected may be higher than expected due to one or more of the following factors:

{% table %}
| Condition | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Lighting | Provide UX and guidance to the user. Jump to [auto$](/age-estimation/user-experience) for more information. | 
| Face positioning | Guide the users to place their face in the middle of the photo you are capturing. A near frontal pose with no obstruction to the facial features. The minimum inter ocular distance is 120 pixels. | 
| Camera angle | Please try to get a face-on photo of the user to get the best result. The cameraâ€™s field of view is too small to provide suitable context around the facial image captured. | 
| Camera type | The API does not work on infrared cameras. To ensure the best performance we are happy to support your testing when evaluating camera options. | 
| Image cropping | Further image cropping can also reduce the context around the facial image captured. This can negatively impact the ability of the algorithm to compare to other â€˜normalâ€™ images in its learned model. | 
| Glare / Blur | Insufficient anti-glare capabilities of either the lens or the glass will make it harder for the anti-spoofing to accurately detect edges around faces. This can negatively impact the ability of the algorithm to compare to other â€˜normalâ€™ images in its learned model. | 
| Zoom | Optical zoom effects can reduce the context around the facial image captured. This can negatively impact the ability of the algorithm to compare to other â€˜normalâ€™ images in its learned model. A distorted lens structure, such as a â€˜fish-eyeâ€™ lens which is not how the AI model has been trained. | 
| Image compression | Too much image compression is applied to the captured image which creates â€˜artefactsâ€™ and inaccuracies in the image (ideally no more than 90% compression). This can negatively impact the ability of the algorithm to compare to other â€˜normalâ€™ images in its learned model. | 
{% /table %}

## Face Capture

For optimal results, Yoti provides and recommends to use the [Yoti Face Capture](/age-estimation/face-capture-module) modules, which are designed to capture optimal images meeting the requirements of the API. This is available as a Native package, and Web implementation.

## Using Yoti responsibly

We pride ourselves on how we handle our users' data. We use tech for good and enable users to securely prove their identity or age, always being transparent about what happens to their details.

- Be transparent about why you're collecting data and only use this data for those reasons.
- Only collect the information you actually need. Data minimisation is one of the main benefits of Yoti, so people don't have to provide more information than is actually necessary.
- Make sure any information you export to your own systems is stored securely. Data security is at the heart of what we do and we think it should be important to every organisation.
