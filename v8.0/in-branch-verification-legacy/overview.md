In-Branch Verification is a service for organisations who require In-person  identity verification and document validation. This service will use Yoti's Identity verification capability combined with a face-to-face transaction to provide identity and proof of address document validation and identity verification to clients who require additional assurance to meet business risk or regulatory obligations, or to customers who require the additional assistance that a branch can provide.

In-Branch Verification is also used to facilitate Identity checking through the DBS documents-based route.

## Using Yoti responsibly

We pride ourselves on how we handle our users' data. We use tech for good and enable users to securely prove their identity, always being transparent about what happens to their details. We ask that you follow these principles.

- Be transparent about why you're collecting this data and only use the data for those reasons.
- Only collect the information you actually need. Data minimisation is one of the main benefits of Yoti, allowing people only to share whatâ€™s really necessary for a particular purpose.
- Make sure the data you collect is stored securely. Data security is at the heart of what we do and we think it should be important to every organisation.
