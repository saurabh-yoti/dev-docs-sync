The IBV integration process can be split up into three main steps:

1. Collect applicant information
2. Configure the session
3. Retrieve the results of the session

#### Collecting applicant information

Before integrating with the Yoti API you will need to gather information of the applicant, explained in the next page. You will also need to know the documents that the applicant will be using and know which post office branch they will be going to.

#### Configuring the session

Once all applicant information has been gathered, the next step is to request the required checks that the applicant will need to undergo. And then generate the instructions that can be sent out to the applicant.

#### Retrieving results

Once the applicant actually goes through the in branch verification process you will be able to retrieve the results of the session. You can be notified when this will be possible by subscribing to our notification service.
