You can choose to send your users a simplified email with the printed certificate attached. 

This option is configurable in a new Settings &gt; Email tab. This option requires that the printed certificate is enabled as, not doing so, would result in sending an email to customers that wouldn't provide a result. Please see next page for more information. 

When selected, the email sent to customers won't contain any information about test results or details. It will only direct the user to the attached results.

This option isn't suited for UK testing schemes such as Day 2 or Test to Release as the simplified email won't contain any of the legally required NHS disclaimers.
