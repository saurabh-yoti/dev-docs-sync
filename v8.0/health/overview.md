Welcome to the documentation for using the Health testing service. Individuals can have their test results directly issued to their phone via the Yoti app, where their information is securely stored as encrypted data that only they can unlock. Users can use the app to securely share their test results, both in person and digitally.

## Technical overview

Yoti supports two types of testing:

- RT-PCR & RT-LAMP testing
- Lateral flow testing. 

There are 4 personas:

1. The customer. The user that is performing the swab / test. 
2. The collector. The user that will be processing the results. 
3. The technician. The user that will be dealing with the machines.
4. The admin. The owner of the portal.

The process flows for sample collection is shown below:

## Using Yoti responsibly

We pride ourselves on how we handle our users' data. We use tech for good and enable users to securely prove their identity or age, always being transparent about what happens to their details.

- Be transparent about why you're collecting data and only use this data for those reasons.
- Only collect the information you actually need. Data minimisation is one of the main benefits of Yoti, so people don't have to provide more information than is actually necessary.
- Make sure any information you export to your own systems is stored securely. Data security is at the heart of what we do and we think it should be important to every organisation.
