This page provides information on the released versions of our Secure Face Capture Module (FCM). We have a standard 18-month support cycle, whereby a module version will be active for 1 year and then 1/2 year in deprecation mode.

You should migrate to a supported version before the end of its deprecation period.

The following table lists the released versions and their support timeline:

{% table %}
| Version | Release Date | End of Active Period | End of Deprecation Period | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 1.4.0 | 11-05-2023 | 11-05-2024 | 11-11-2024 | 
| 1.3.0 | 16-03-2023 | 16-03-2024 | 16-09-2024 | 
| 1.2.0 | 19-12-2022 | 19-12-2023 | 19-06-2024 | 
| 1.1.0 | 02-08-2022 | 02-08-2023 | 02-02-2024 |
