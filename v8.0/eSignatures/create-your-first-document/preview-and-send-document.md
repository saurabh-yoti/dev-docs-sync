This guide will show you how to:

- View a preview of the document
- Customise your email to the signer
- Set up reminders to the signer. You can send three automatic reminder emails to signers who are yet to sign.

You have the ability to go back and change what you need to.

## Send the document

At this point you can customise an email to send to the signer and set a reminder. You can also send a reminder manually.
