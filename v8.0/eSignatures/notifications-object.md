You can subscribe to notifications which will be sent to a specified endpoint. This endpoint will need to be publicly accessible.

{% code %}
{% tab language="json" %}
"notifications": {
        "destination": "https://mysite.com/events",
        "subscriptions": [
            "envelope_completion",
            "envelope_ready",
            "signer_completion",
            "upload_errors",
            "idv_resource_update",
            "idv_session_completion",
            "idv_check_completion",
            "idv_task_completion",

| Parameter | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| destination | Endpoint for notifications to be sent to. Only HTTPS endpoints with TLS 1.2 are supported. | 
| envelope_completion | When all recipients have signed the document. | 
| envelope_ready | The document is sealed. | 
| envelope_created | The document is sealed.\n\n\n\n- this is an alias for envelope_ready\n- “envelope_ready” and “envelope_created” can both be subscribed to in the same envelope. If they are, both will be sent in the same trigger | 
| signer_completion | The signer has signed. | 
| upload_errors | When there is an error in the envelope creation process. | 
| idv_resource_update | Specific to envelopes with an Identity verification check enabled. Update received whenever there are changes to **resources** in the IDV session. For example, a user uploading a new document. | 
| idv_session_completion | Specific to envelopes with an Identity verification check enabled. Triggered when all tasks and all checks inside of a given session have been completed. | 
| idv_check_completion | Specific to envelopes with an Identity verification check enabled. Sent when a check completes – for example a document authenticity check being performed. | 
| idv_task_completion | Specific to envelopes with an Identity verification check enabled. Sent when a task is completed. If you require TEXT_EXTRACTION and the check has been fulfilled, Yoti will send this through as an update to your endpoint. | 
| idv_session_limit_reached | Specific to envelopes with an Identity verification check enabled. When a recipient has reached their session limit. You can use the reset session limit endpoint to if you want the recipient to try again |
