Conditional logic allows you to specify that certain conditions must be met, before triggering an action. The available actions are show or hide, the trigger for these actions is defined within rules.

{% code %}
{% tab language="json" %}
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "action": "show",
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "trigger_tag_name": "sign-here",
                    "criteria": "has_value"
                }
            ],
            "affected_tag_names": [
                "signee-name"
            ]
