Integrating with Yoti lets your users securely share specific details using their Digital ID app. We call these details attributes, the next page goes into detail on what the [auto$](/digital-id/yoti-attributes) are. 

To get started, users need to click a [Yoti button](/digital-id/createbutton) on your website or app. This button opens a full-page overlay on the webpage, showing the details users are about to share.

Once they confirm the share, their details are securely sent to your organisation. You can access them through a backend integration or from the [**Yoti Hub**.](https://hub.yoti.com/login)

## The user flow

When your user clicks the Yoti button on your website or app, a full-page overlay appears. This tell them exactly what details they'll be sharing and who they'll be sharing them with.

{% /image %}

1. Your application's logo and name. Make sure they match what's on the website or app your user has come from.
2. The specific details you're requesting users to share.
3. On desktop browsers: a Yoti QR code that users scan with their Digital ID app. On mobile browsers: a share button that will automatically open the Digital ID app.
4. Your application's contact details and privacy policy. Make sure you provide these.
5. More information for users to find out how Yoti works and how to share details.

Once your user has scanned the QR code on their desktop or tapped the Share details button on their mobile, the Digital ID app automatically presents a share request screen.

## Using Yoti responsibly

We pride ourselves on how we handle our users' data. We use tech for good and enable users to securely prove their identity or age, always being transparent about what happens to their details.

- Be transparent about why you're collecting data and only use this data for those reasons.
- Only collect the information you actually need. Data minimisation is one of the main benefits of Yoti, so people don't have to provide more information than is actually necessary.
- Make sure any information you export to your own systems is stored securely. Data security is at the heart of what we do and we think it should be important to every organisation.
