Yoti performs numerous checks on a document in order to generate this report. Yoti will also provide a recommendation for the authenticity of the document:

{% table widths="212" %}
| Recommendation | Explained | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| üü¢ APPROVE | The document has passed Yoti verification standards. | 
| üî¥  REJECT | The document could be tampered or a counterfeit. Yoti recommends you flag users that are rejected. | 
| **üü†** NOT_AVAILABLE | Yoti couldn‚Äôt perform the check, usually due to the quality of submitted images or user error. | 
{% /table %}

As part of the document check, Yoti performs multiple sub checks on the document explained below. The results for the sub checks will be PASS or FAIL. All sub checks state whether the check was performed through a manual process (Expert Review), or through Automation.
