- Click add user
- Type in the personâ€™s email address.
- Once you add a user, they will get emailed a link to the portal and will need to create an account on the portal.

All users will receive an email from Yoti. They will then need to register on the portal at [https://identity.yoti.com/iam/create](https://identity.yoti.com/iam/create). The new users will be guided through this via the email they receive.

You can edit a users permission to be able to just view the result of the checks or to also be able to view the details of the check.
