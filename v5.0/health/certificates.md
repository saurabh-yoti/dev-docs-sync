      Before you start
   </div>
   <div class="alert-text" >

   </div>
   <div class="alert-links">

## Verify your certificate

Yoti has developed a QR scanner to verify your Health certificates. Our QR code scanner gives you a simple and secure way to verify that credentials are presented by their rightful owner.

By working closely with governments and health organisations, we've developed our technology to protect you and your customers against unauthorised access when checking for SARS-CoV-2 test results, vaccination records or other medical EMR records.

Our QR codes are W3C compliant Verifiable Credentials. They're digitally signed and can't be tampered with to give wrong results.

Head over to : [scan.yoti.com. ](https://scan.yoti.com/)

Scan the QR code on the printed certificate and you will see the users verified test results.
