Yoti supports multiple documents and documents types from all over the world! These are stored as attributes on the Digital ID app. For a full list of the documents we support please head over to our [FAQ's](https://support.yoti.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002886594-What-ID-documents-do-you-currently-support-).

This section describes all the attributes Yoti supports in more detail. If you wish to select attributes for your integration you will need to ensure you have a Hub account and create a Digital ID application. 

{% badge type="info" text="Hint" /%} Different ID documents have different attributes, bare this in mind when requesting attributes. 

There is a small explanation of each attribute and what the content type is:

{% /table %}

*These attributes are not available via the Hub UI. You will need to use the advanced policy view - See blow.

### Remember me id explained

Yoti generates two user identifiers and provides them to your web application. One of these identifiers relates the user globally across your organisation and the second is specific to the application they are sharing with.

If a user visits your web app again, the same identifier is provided, so that your system can recognise them as returning users. If you would like your application to be anonymous you will need to untick this in the Yoti Hub.

{% badge type="info" text="Hint" /%} If user's delete the Digital ID app, and do not take a back up they will generate a new remember me ID.

### Add source / verifier constraint

On the Digital ID, the document the user adds last will default to be the source of the attributes shared. If you wish to ensure your attributes have come from a specific source please follow the below instructions:

1) Log on to the[ Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com/login)

2) Navigate to your application created.

3) Navigate to your scenario name and click on this.

4) The URL should look like this: [https://hub.yoti.com/organisations/[org_id]/applications/[app_id]/scenarios/[scenario_id]/edit](https://hub.yoti.com/organisations/%5Borg_id%5D/applications/%5Bapp_id%5D/scenarios/%5Bscenario_id%5D/edit). To activate the advanced policy mode append **/advanced** to this url.

5) Find the attributes you want with a source constraint and add an anchor source. See below for an example with a full name and date of birth.

{% code %}
{% tab language="json" %}
{
          constraints: [
            {
              type: 'SOURCE',
              preferred_sources: {
                anchors: [

                    name: 'PASSPORT',
                    sub_type: ''
                  }
                ],
                soft_preference: false
