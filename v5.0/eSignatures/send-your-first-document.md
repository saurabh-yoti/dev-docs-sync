Add a non signer recipient

You can add a non signing recipient, who will receive a copy of the completion pack. The non signing recipient (CC recipient) does not receive an invitation to the envelope, once the envelope is complete and all signers have signed then the completion pack email is triggered and is sent to all recipients including non signing recipients.

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1628071299/v2_2762/zruk2qryjxmo1gifgzsf.png" caption="Non signer flow" mode="responsive" height="319" width="949" %}
{% /image %}

To enable a non signer recipient click: Receives a copy.

### Signing order

The portal has the ability to do signing orders. This will you to mandate that a certain signee signs before/after the rest. If you wish to enable this feature toggle **ON** signing order.

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1616082723/v2_2762/hzfdsb8fh0snwbpudbkv.png" caption="Signing order" mode="responsive" height="448" width="929" %}
{% /image %}

- Press **ADD**
- Press **NEXT** when you have added your signers.

### One time password

If you would like to enhance security when sending across your document you can enable OTP (one time password). 

- Toggle the One time password on

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1624568525/v2_2762/agkzrzkjwo5z1vjei7yg.png" caption="One time password" mode="responsive" height="1306" width="1958" %}
{% /image %}

- Enter a mobile number. 

When the signer opens their document they will need to provide a OTP:

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1624569030/v2_2762/pparhigzsdd4st3jeb1h.png" caption="OTP message" mode="300" height="686" width="898" %}
{% /image %}

After they press continue they must enter the verification code to continue. 

### Add a witness

At this point, you have uploaded a document and added a signer. You can add a witness to each document in the envelope. 

{% badge type="success" text="Hint" /%} If you add a witness, OTP will automatically be mandatory. 

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1624568371/v2_2762/vcypb6s9vij9rztnlt53.png" mode="responsive" height="1034" width="1854" %}
{% /image %}

When you send off this document, the signer will receive an email highlighting to them that a witness is required. We mention here that it is a legal requirement that the witness sees the signer applying the digital signature. 

The signer will also receive a pop up before signing the document:

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1624569362/v2_2762/hbbdhzgttydmawok4rsr.png" caption="Witness explainer" mode="300" height="1210" width="1046" %}
{% /image %}

The signer will complete their signing and will be asked to enter their witness details. 

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1624569456/v2_2762/sojfihizlhy7h8dfcipk.png" caption="Witness details" mode="300" height="1018" width="802" %}
{% /image %}

The witness will now receive an email with full context of the signing ceremony for them. They will have to enter a OTP and they will have to confirm they were physically present when the document was signed. 

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1624607980/v2_2762/nj09dcnyrvzfjecq36bs.png" caption="Witness agreement" mode="responsive" height="1182" width="2122" %}
{% /image %}

{% badge type="success" text="Hint" /%} The witness cannot move forward without confirming this.

They will then have to sign the document. Yoti only shows the signature part of the document and nothing else. 

Please see video explainer:

{% /video %}

### Edit the witness

The primary signer will receive an email asking them to sign their document. If the first signer has successfully signed their document they can still change the witness details in case of a  spelling mistake / the witness details are inputted wrong.

- On the email they receive they will need to click view document:

{% image url="https://res.cloudinary.com/developerhub/image/upload/v1626799993/v2_2762/tsdzo6b9tkkbgqmrzzzh.png" caption="Primary signer email" mode="responsive" height="531" width="874" %}
{% /image %}
