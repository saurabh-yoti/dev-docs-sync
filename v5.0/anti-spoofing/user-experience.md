Create optimal experiences for your customers and increase conversion by following these best practices for web and mobile integrations.

In this section, we offer tips and considerations to create a great and simple experience for your users.

While Yoti provides a privacy-friendly approach that does not mean customers will be comfortable having a photo taken of them. There are aspects surrounding this action that raise questions, concerns or even irrational thought, resulting in users subjectively opposing the use of the technology.

These aspects can be averted if the right information is provided at the right times during the process.

## Guidance

We recognise three aspects that can affect the accuracy of an age estimation. That’s why we recommend providing the following before a photo capture, so that a user can ensure a successful scan of their face:

{% image url="https://image-archive.developerhub.io/image/upload/20553/t1mnojeu6ykcelytlvb4/1583315383.png" caption="Guidance images" mode="300" height="284" width="720" %}
{% /image %}

Light of the face should be as evenly lit as possible, so ensuring a user is in a well lit area, helps to reduce the uncertainty of the age estimation.

Only hats that create significant shadow across the face can cause uncertainty. Most hats that do not cover the face and are not shadow intensive should not have to be removed.

## Reassurance

We recommend highlighting this content before a photo capture to alleviate these concerns:

{% /image %}

Ensure that you are being transparent with regards to what the photo is going to be used for and make sure that it gets permanently deleted from your system once the age estimation has been performed.

Reassure users with the fact that they cannot be identified personally.

Build confidence by letting them know a camera will be used and that they need to enable access to the camera to proceed. Most web browsers will automatically provide an overlay asking the user to allow this access.

## Powered by Yoti

Users who choose integration this service should add our persistent ‘Powered by Yoti’ mark. This should remain on-screen for the duration of the photo capture.

Please do not alter or create your own asset. Please contact us with regards to assets at [clientsupport@yoti.com](mailto:clientsupport@yoti.com). You will need to provide a powered by Yoti logo on your liveness service.
