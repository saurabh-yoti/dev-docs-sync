The next step is to load the Yoti client view. Here we describe how to:

- Launch the web client
- Or launch the mobile client

In the previous section we saw how to create a request, which returns:

- Session ID
- Session Token

We then use these to construct a URL which loads the Yoti Client view. The URL can be used in the following ways:

- Within an iframe on your webpage
- As a link on your webpage
- As a link shared securely with a user

{% code %}
{% tab language="http" %}
https://api.yoti.com/idverify/v1/web/index.html?sessionID=<inputsessionID>&sessionToken=<yoursessionToken>
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

{% table %}
| URL Component | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| sessionId | The session ID from the Yoti response. | 
| sessionToken | The session token from the Yoti response. | 
{% /table %}

The example below demonstrates the use of an iframe:

{% code %}
{% tab language="markdown" %}
<iframe src="<https://api.yoti.com/idverify/v1/web/index.html?sessionID=<inputsessionID>&sessionToken=<yoursessionTokenID>" style="height:605px; width:100%; border:none;" allow="camera"></iframe>
{% /tab %}
{% /code %}

Once the Yoti Client SDK has launched it will take the user through the ID document capture flow.

Please note: `allow="camera"` is required when using Yoti Identity verification on mobiles (web or native), and is serving the website over HTTPS.
