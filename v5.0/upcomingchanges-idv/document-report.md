## Document report

Yoti performs numerous checks on a document in order to generate this report. Yoti will also provide a recommendation for the authenticity of the document:

{% table %}
| Recommendation | Explained | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| APPROVE | The document has passed Yoti verification standards. | 
| REJECT | The document could be tampered or a counterfeit. Yoti recommends you flag users that are rejected. | 
| NOT_AVAILABLE | Yoti couldnâ€™t perform the check, usually due to the quality of submitted images or user error. | 
{% /table %}

### Sub checks

As part of the document check, Yoti performs multiple sub checks on the document explained below. The outcome for these will either be PASS or FAIL.

{% badge type="success" text="Hint" /%} Only checks attempted will be shown in the response.
