You have two options when deleting the session. You can either

- Delete the media associated with the session
- Delete the session entirely.

{% html %}
<div class="alert-GTK">
    <div class="alert-title" id="GTK">
        Good to know
    </div>
    <div class="alert-text">
A user will need to have specific permissions to perform these actions that can be added in Hub.
    </div>
</div>
{% /html %}

## Delete the media

By deleting the media associated with the session, you can remove all of you customerâ€™s PII and still keep the recommendations from Yoti, the session details and the decision you have added for your records. The check will continue to show up in the session list.

To do this you will need to:

- Navigate to the correct session
- Click through each media item and delete them individually at the moment. In the future we will allow you to delete it all in one go.
