## Your Privacy Policy

You should consider updating your privacy policy to tell users about the Yoti IDV service. This will help you meet the general obligation of transparency to your users. We recommend your Legal Council or Data Protection Officer  writes the section, below is a suggested paragraph to be used as a starting point:

_
_

_"To help establish your identity we use Yoti Limited (Yoti USA Inc in the USA) to check your identity. When you submit your ID document Yoti extracts data from it. If you are asked to submit a selfie then Yoti uses biometric technology to check that the selfie is of a real person and that your selfie matches the photo on the ID document. Yoti then sends us the results of the checks. Yoti does not do anything else with the data and Yoti deletes it [after 7 days OR [insert the data retention period you configure on integration]]. We keep the data [for as long as you have an account with us, plus three years]."_
