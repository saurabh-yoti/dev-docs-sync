In order to expedite the Collection flow, you may choose to allow your customer to pre-register. If this option is enabled, you will be able to upload your customer's details via a csv file in the **Customer data** tab in **Admin**. You must have the **Customer data** permission to be able to access the **Customer data** area.

The csv should contain all the data you require from your customers, as per the [template](https://www.yoti.com/wp-content/uploads/Pre-registration-template.csv) displayed under. Once the customer has been tested, their details will be removed from the database where they were stored.

If you enable this the flow for you will be as follows:

- Scan QR code on bag or type in the Bag ID.
