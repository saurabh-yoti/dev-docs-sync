If you wish to request a liveness check from the user this section will provide you with all the details to complete this. Each check will provide a report of the result from the liveness check.

Here we describe:

- What is a liveness check.
- The results

## Liveness check

A requested check to assess whether the document scan is being performed by a real person, and not someone wearing a mask or an automated system. Whilst the liveness test is being performed Yoti will take 3 images of the user.

You must provide the max number of retries your users can have before the liveness is failed. This must be minimum 1 attempt. Yoti recommends 3 attempts as a max retry number.

{% table %}
| Name | Resources | Type | Manual check available | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Liveness | 1x Liveness Resource | Synchronous | ‚ùå | 
{% /table %}

## The results

Liveness checks can sometimes be difficult for users to perform correctly, as they need to position themselves in front of the camera and move in a particular way. 

{% table widths="123" %}
| Response | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| APPROVE üü¢ | The user has passed the liveness test | 
| REJECT üî¥ | Our result suggests it's likely that the user is an automated program (a 'bot'), or somebody holding a photograph, mask or other disguise in front of the camera. Ensure you have reviewed the document response, if this is approved you can ask your users to try a new session. | 
{% /table %}

As part of the liveness check, Yoti performs the following sub check on the face capture explained below which will either PASS or FAIL.

{% table %}
| Sub check | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| liveness_auth | If FAIL, the check will recommend REJECT with no reason given. |
