### Prove identity

Customers use the free Yoti app to securely share pre-verified details with your business. Customers only need to verify themselves once using the app.

{% /image %}

### Layouts

It is recommended that the vertical order of the structure above is maintained. For desktop users where horizontal space exists, we recommend separating **How To** from other sections as shown below:

{% /image %}

### Flows

You can choose what data you request from the user, to see what attributes we offer please head [here](https://developers.yoti.com/yoti/knowledge-base-hub#yoti-attributes-explained).

The flow from your site would be similar to this for verify:-
