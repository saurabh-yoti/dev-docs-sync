_Thanks for making this happen. Its surreal when you think of it that your work in another country will be used to allow volunteers drive through police checkpoints and use priorities queue’s in retail outlets in County Tipperary._

_Using Yoti has been a really smooth experience. It allows us to easily verify the identity of volunteers who have been recruited remotely in line with our organisation’s safeguarding procedures, while giving the volunteers complete control over their data. Creating a Yoti Hub is a very simple and clean process, but if there are any issues the support is super-fast and really helpful. Definitely, the perfect fit for our organisation!_

_"Yoti has provided an innovative, easy to use, cost effective and Covid-friendly solution for our workforce ID badges within the care sector.  We used to struggle getting physical ID badges back if employee's left, but now it's as simple as removing a name from a list and their ID will no longer be active which safeguards vulnerable people.  Customer service is also responsive, friendly and helpful - we highly recommend Yoti as a futureproof digital solution for any organisation / sector."_

_"Firstly let me say how impressed I’ve been with the developer experience of Yoti so far. The care and attention to detail that has gone into the developer and integration story is clear to see and allowed me to quickly and easily integrate your system into our application. The support team were available to answer my questions when I had the wrong end of the stick, but everything else was straight forward and driven by your excellent documentation, and github samples. In particular I was impressed with the work that has gone into the SDK, which clearly hides away much of the complexity of the platform and allows a quick and easy integration without sacrificing any of the security or flexibility of Yoti as a platform."_

_"Integrating with Yoti took about 15 minutes. It took few hours to download visual studio 2017 and compile dlls' though (we work with 2013)."__
