- Click add new user
- Type in the person’s email address.
- Once you add a user, they will get emailed a link to the portal and will need to create an account on the portal.

By default people that are added to the portal will have the ‘View sessions’ permission.

All users will receive an email from Yoti. They will then need to register on the portal at [https://identity.yoti.com/iam/create](https://identity.yoti.com/iam/create). The new users will be guided through this via the email they receive.
