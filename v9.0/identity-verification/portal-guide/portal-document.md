You can enable a request to assess the characteristics of a document and to determine the validity of the ID document. Yoti will perform multiple checks on a ID document.

You can configure two options here:

1. Decide on capture mode. Users can either upload / take an image of their photo. You can configure which setting you want by ticking the box above.
2. Filter out document types you want to accept. Click on the small arrow under Document 1 and choose your preferences.

If you would like to collect two ID documents please click request additional document click Request additional document. If you request your users to upload more than one document we offer the ability to cross check the data. You must have text extraction on both documents enabled.
