You should consider updating your privacy policy to tell users about the Yoti IDV service. This will help you meet the general obligation of transparency to your users. We recommend your Legal Council or Data Protection Officer  writes the section, below are examples on suggested paragraphs to be used as a starting point:

_"To help establish your identity we use Yoti Limited (Yoti USA Inc in the USA) to check your identity. When you submit your ID document Yoti extracts data from it such as your name and date of birth. If you are asked to submit a selfie then Yoti uses its technology to check that the selfie is of a real person and that your selfie matches the photo on the ID document. Yoti then sends us the results of the checks. Yoti does not do anything else with the data and Yoti deletes it after 28 days. We keep the data [insert retention period configured upon integration - Yoti default is 7 days]."_
