It is possible to extend the Identity verification integration by requesting an address verification as part of a session.

{% callout type="info" title="Good to know" %}
An address check is performed when requested through an 'Identity Plus Address' scheme via any target assurance level.
{% /callout %}

This check will facilitate an extra verification of a user by searching a personâ€™s details against a collated database from various sources worldwide.

Yoti will need to capture the user's address so you will need to allow the following checks:

Note: not all ID documents contain the users address.
