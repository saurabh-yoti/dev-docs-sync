The user's image is securely transmitted to the Yoti API with an optional layer of security to the service and ensure the user is using their own face for estimation. 

- Age estimation
    - Version 2: This requires a higher quality image, and allows to combine age estimation with our anti-spoofing check.
    - Version 1: This allows a lower quality image, and only performs age estimation.

- Face capture
- Anti-spoofing - This allows to integrate our passive liveness detection as a standalone check.
