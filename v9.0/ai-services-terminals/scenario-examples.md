1. **Options** - Ensure you provide the Age estimation service with clear context and alongside any other ways to verify a user’s age.
2. **Education** - Reassure your users by giving them the information they need to continue with age verification.
3. **Estimation** - Enable your users to complete a successful age estimation by providing contextual guidance at the point of estimation.
4. **Result** - Whether or not they pass your age threshold, tell them of their result clearly with as little words as possible. Follow this with actions to take.
5. **Redirect -** Where applicable, increase confidence and reduce hesitation by showing on your website that they have successfully completed age verification, and provide clear actions to continue with your website’s user journey.

### Layout for options

It is recommended that you present Age estimation  with any other options available. If age estimation is the only form of age verification provided, then be clear what users will be asked to do to complete their current task.

### Layout for estimation

It is recommended that for desktop, you present a camera feed for image capture centrally in the available viewport. For mobile, we recommend using the full available space of the screen to ensure a high quality image capture.

### Layout for result

It is recommended that for both mobile and desktop, you present the result with both visual and text. Be clear as to what happens next, we suggest an automatic redirect after 4 seconds to take users back to the task they want to complete on your website.
