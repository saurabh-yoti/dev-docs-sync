_"Firstly I would like to say how excellent James Lancaster was throughout the entire process, he gave a clear and concise demonstration and answered all questions we had. My entire sales team and I were very impressed with the Yoti Sign tool as well as James. We moved away from DocuSign for various reasons but the main reason was that Yoti Sign offer real value for money, switching over will save us a huge amount each year plus the aftercare has been exceptional. A few team members had some questions and James has always been there to get these resolved asap. highly recommended!"_

_"It's very simple to use, just drag and drop. Having the signed documents stored online is fantastic for peace of mind. Much more cost effective than other systems I checked out, it's easy to use and does everything you would want for an online document signing service._

_It helps with my compliance and keeping records. Before I was just going on a handshake and email, now I have formal, signed terms and conditions documents which are handled automatically before I start any work."_

_"Yoti Sign is a simple and easy to use E-Signing platform. Definitely worth while exploring Yoti Sign against the competition. For our requirements Yoti Sign delivered exactly the same functionality as the market leaders but for a fraction of the cost. The staff at Yoti Sign have been helpful and accommodating all the way through. They ask for recommendations for system improvements and communicate with us on a regular basis regarding the latest improvements being deployed._

_Previously there was no e-signing solution in place which meant all contracts and agreements had to be sent out via the traditional postal method. This resulted in a reliance on postal timelines and the requirement for the recipient to action and return in a timeline that suited them._

_The business identified the need to implement a E-Signing solution to reduce the turnaround time, and to allow us to have the opportunity to closer control the return process._

_After reviewing Yoti Sign versus the competition in the market place Yoti Sign won hands down for our needs._

_Currently we do not receive the KPI's in a format that is 100% suitable to our needs but Yoti Sign are working to develop this for us. However via the internal KPI monitoring processes we have seen a 75% reduction in turnaround time for one area that needs a customer signature."_
