The mobile integration provides a native version of Yoti Doc Scan which can be integrated into your own Mobile App, as opposed to being rendered through a webpage.

This integration requires a valid Yoti Doc Scan session, it is recommended that you view the [auto$](/yoti-doc-scan/yoti-doc-scan-integration) and know how to generate a session before starting.

For a detailed explanation please visit our GitHub pages.
