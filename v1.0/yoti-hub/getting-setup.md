## Overview

The overview page is designed to provide you with a snapshot of your account. You will see:

- Top 4 Yoti Applications with the highest number of receipts
- Total number of account collaborators and their status (Active, Pending, Deleted)
- Total number of Yoti Pages used and their status (Active, Draft)

## Settings

The Settings page allows you to view your organisation details, update your billing information and add a payment card.

We appreciate that your organisation details may not remain the same as when you first registered, should any information change, please contact us at [organisations@yoti.com](mailto:organisations@yoti.com) for us to update it. This ensures that we can verify any changes and keep information aligned.

## Collaborators in Yoti Hub

As the applicant of the organisation, you will instantly gain full access to your Yoti Organisation Hub.

You will have the ability to add collaborators to your organisation. This will allow multiple people to log in to the same organisation and manage its applications.

To add collaborators, log in to your organisation and:

1. Go to the side menu and click People
2. Click Add an administrator
3. Fill in the details - please make sure the email address you use to invite the user to your organisation is the same as their email address in their Yoti

Once you have completed this the user will receive an email and will gain access to your Hub after they scan the QR code sent to them.

We strongly recommend you add another user to your Hub as a backup user should you lose access to your Yoti account.

## Permissions

Permissions let users perform certain actions within organisations, applications and pages.

### Organisation Permissions

You need to be an admin to assign organisation permissions to users.

When a user gets invited to an organisation they don't have any permissions by default. But they can still accept the invitation and access the organisation. An organisation admin is able to give permissions to a user from the Permissions tab on their profile page.

{% table %}
| Permission | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| No permissions | Users can view the overview page, the list an organisation's applications and pages, and the list of members. | 
| Create Applications and Pages | Users can create applications and pages within the organisation. They become the admin of those applications and pages. | 
| Edit Settings | Users can view the organisation's settings, manage payment cards and add missing organisation details. | 
| Manage Members | Users can view and edit member information, invite new users and remove pending users. | 
| Admin | Admins inherit all of the permissions above. They can also set and update permissions for users, delete active users and gain admin access to every application and page within the organisation. | 
{% /table %}

### Application Permissions

Once a user is part of an organisation, they can be invited as collaborators for individual applications and pages.  An organisation admin can set collaborator permissions for a user in their profile page, or they can be set in the Collaborator tab within the application or page.

Once a user is added as a collaborator of an application or page they automatically get collaborator permissions.

{% table %}
| Permission | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| No permissions | All members of an organisation can see all applications and pages on the overview page. | 
| Collaborator | Users can view the Scenarios and Keys tabs. | 
| Access Receipts | Users can view, filter and download receipts. | 
| Edit | Users can edit application and page details, create, update and delete Scenarios, generate keys and update the states of the applications and pages. | 
| Admin | Admins inherit all of the permissions above. They can also add collaborators and set permissions for them and delete applications, pages and receipts. |
