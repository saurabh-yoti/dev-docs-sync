## Overview

Yoti Hub allows you to onboard your business with Yoti and set up everything you need to integrate Yoti into your products.

Your organisation will be structured as follows:

Organisation > Applications > Scenarios

- You can create multiple applications within your organisation, each application refers to a domain and has its own users.
- Within each application you can create multiple scenarios for each of your use cases. These can be set up to request different attributes from your users and will direct the user to a chosen page within your domain.

## Sign up to Hub

To start your integration you will need to register your business with Yoti. The first step will require you to create a Yoti account in the Yoti app and add your ID document and email address.

If you haven’t got it already, you can find it on both the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yoti-your-digital-identity-app/id983980808) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yoti.mobile.android.live).

Once you have created your Yoti, go to [https://hub.yoti.com/login-organisations](https://www.yoti.com/dashboard/login-organisations) on your desktop computer or laptop to register your organisation.

## Creating an Organisation

Open the Yoti app on your phone, tap Scan Code and scan the QR code displayed on your desktop screen.

Once there, you will need to fill out a basic form with the following information:

{% table %}
| Information Requested | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| &lt;b&gt;Organisation Details&lt;/b&gt; | As shown on the company register for your jurisdiction. This is required for us to verify your company. | 
| &lt;b&gt;Registered Company Address&lt;/b&gt; | This is required as additional verification and to have an address for billing purposes.&lt;br&gt; | 
| &lt;b&gt;Director Information&lt;/b&gt; | This will consist of the directors full names and email address for verification. | 
| &lt;b&gt;Yoti Terms and Conditions&lt;/b&gt; | If you require a copy of this, please contact &lt;a href="mailto:onboarding@yoti.com"&gt;onboarding@yoti.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; | 
| &lt;b&gt;Billing Details&lt;/b&gt; | This is required to ensure we have the correct billing details on file. | 
{% /table %}

Once your organisation has been created, our onboarding team will review your application within 2-3 business hours. You will still be able to start your integration while your organisation is under review.

## Log in to Hub

Once you have registered your business with Yoti you can use [https://hub.yoti.com/](https://www.yoti.com/dashboard) to log in.  As before, open the Yoti app on your phone, tap Scan and scan the QR code displayed on your desktop computer.

Please note: Once you have logged in to Hub, your phone will show a ‘connected’ screen. To keep your data secure, we make sure that only your phone can decipher it. For this reason, you’ll need to keep the Yoti app active whilst you are using Hub. If you leave the Yoti app, you may need to log in again. You will be able to create and edit applications if you lose connection but won't be able to see receipts.
