Below are tests for visually distinguishing between different types of content to provide a more easily digestible and navigable page.

{% callout type="warning" title="Before you start" %}
This is our visual component to help users understand what they need to do before they continue completing the tasks described on this page.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="info" title="Info" %}
This is an information block where we want to provide a spotlight on smaller pieces of information that are not directly part of tasks the user is trying to complete.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="success" title="Success" %}

{% /callout %}
