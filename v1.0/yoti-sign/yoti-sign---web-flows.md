This user guide will walk you through the Yoti Sign web flow, the different features on the platform and an end-to-end overview of how to upload and send a document.

## Logging In/Signing Up

If you're new to the Yoti Sign platform, you'll first need to register for an account to begin using the service. You can sign up using [this link](https://www.yotisign.com/app/contact-us/) where you will be asked to fill out some basic information about yourself.

When using Yoti Sign, there are two options for you to choose from to gain access to your account:

- Email Address/Password
- Yoti Login

You'll have the option to choose which one you'd like to use to login to your account. Please make sure that the email address marked as default in the Yoti app, is the same email address as the account you would like to access.

## The Hub

Once you've registered and logged in to your Yoti Sign account, you'll be taken to the Active documents page. This page provides an overview on the following:

- The recipient(s) of your documents
- The signing status of your documents
- The date the document was sent

---

## Sending a document

When sending a document, there are few requirements that your document(s) must follow. These are:

- File format must be either DOC, DOCX or PDF
- File size to be **no more than** 15MB
- Ensure the document is not password protected

We will automatically convert your document into a PDF before sending this on to your recipients. You can either click on 'Upload Document' or drag a document into the window. You will be provided with an opportunity to rename your PDF later on in the flow.

### Recipients

When sending a document, you have a choice on the number of individuals you wish to send your document to. You can either add these individuals in manually or initiate a bulk send via CSV.

_Please note this can only be sent to a maximum of 1000 signers._

### Authentication

**Verify with the Yoti app**

This ensures that the email you have entered matches a verified email address from an individuals Yoti. Without this, the document will not be able to be viewed/scanned. For additional verification, you may ask the individual(s) to authenticate using their biometric template from their Yoti.

**Know your Signer**

From here you can select the attributes that you wish to ask from your signer(s). You can choose from the following attributes:

- Full Name
- Phone Number
- Photo
- Gender
- Date of Birth
- Nationality
- Address

You can specify only certain individuals who need to provide a higher level of authentication, meaning your settings won't be applied to all signers of your document.

## Adding fields to your document

Simply drag and drop the fields that map to the attributes you're requesting from Yoti onto page, making sure to align each of them with the corresponding fields. All of the available attributes will be provided to you on the right hand side of the page. For example:
