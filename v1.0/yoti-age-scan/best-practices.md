We will provide you a set of guidelines to use when completing your integration. 

**Technical:**

- Picture size must be below 100K
- Yoti only accepts JPEGâ€™s converted to a base64 image
- The minimum pixel size we accept is 96px x 96px

**User:**

- Ensure that you are being transparent with regards to what the photo is going to be used for and make sure that it gets permanently deleted once the age estimation has been performed.Try to ensure the user has a frame around their face to get their image is successfully captured.
- Try to ensure that you are displaying a frame for the user to place their face so that the image is successfully captured.
- Ideally you want the user front on with their full face on show and close to the camera.
