Post Office provides 270+ different products and services within it's branches, so it's critical for your customers and the Post Office branch staff, that the language we use to describe our services and the way that you refer to our services is consistent. For example:

- **DO**: "Select your documents for your Post Office In-Branch Verification". "Ensure you bring the provided Post Office In Branch Verification letter and your documents to an enabled branch",
- **DON'T**: "Get ready to prove your ID to Post Office.", "Get your documents checked by Post Office", or "Get verified by Post Office."
- When referring to the service, please ensure that you use the full product name of "Post Office In-Branch Verification."
- The supplied PDF should be referred to as the 'In Branch Verification letter', as opposed to a form or application as these terms have a different meaning for Post Office branch staff. Avoid using the terms "certified" or "document certification" as these refer to a different service (Post Office Document Certification Service)
- The Post Office In-Branch Verification service is only available in Identity-enabled branches, which are available and accessible to 98% of the UK population within 10 miles of their residential address. It is critical for customers to be directed to their nearest or most convenient enabled Post Office branch, which is why the Post Office has made it's Location & Data Services API available to use to retrieve branch information and for this selected branch to be included on the In-Branch Verification letter.
