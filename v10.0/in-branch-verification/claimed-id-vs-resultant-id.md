There are a couple of options regarding ID verification via the in branch verification (IBV) service:

1. Supplying a 'claimed ID' where you have gathered a user's details (i.e. name, address and date of birth) and would like the document validation to be done to ensure a match to these attributes. We ask that you supply these details as part of the request for branch verification (session creation).

If you do not provide the 'claimed ID' then you can either:

- Receive document images from the session for processing by your organisation,
- Utilise our data extraction and comparison feature to provide the verified 'resultant ID' to you

#### Claimed ID

In a claimed ID request, you will already have information about the individual e.g name that you will have collected from the applicant. The applicants details will be sent in your request, where the postmaster will then check that these details match that on the ID documents brought in.

#### Resultant ID

In a resultant ID request, you will not necessarily need information on the applicant already. The checks done are on the documents brought in and the data on the documents can be returned to you.

## Embedded UX vs Hosted 'At Home Flow'

Where your organisation has business rules requiring sets of documents to be provided in order to meet your requirements (ie. Disclosure & Barring Service), then we recommend you manage the users document selection within your own UX and create sessions via our API.

If your organisation has more simple evidence rules then you may wish to use the hosted UX that we make available to enable your users to select documents and receive the customer letter.

## Organisation billed vs Customer payment

The in branch service will bill for completed branch verification sessions at the end of each calendar month, but also provides an optional feature to collect payments from your customers in branch to offset these fees, or to also capture and remit additional fees that you may require. Your organisation will be required to register for branch payment remittance and there is a transactional fee to utilise this feature.

For more information, please contact your account manager.
