Yoti supports multiple documents and documents types from all over the world! These are stored as attributes on the Digital ID app.

This section describes all the attributes Yoti supports in more detail. If you wish to select attributes for your integration you will need to ensure you have a Hub account and create a Digital ID application. 

{% callout type="info" title="Good to know" %}
Different ID documents have different attributes, bear this in mind when requesting attributes. e.g. A Nationality attribute is common for a Passport.
{% /callout %}

There is a small explanation of each attribute and what the content type is:

### Parent and Remember Me ID explained

When a user completes a share with you, Yoti generates two unique Remember Me IDs. 

One is for the specific application being used, and one is at an organisation level (parent). This means the user does not have to share their personal details every time, as you can just ask for your Remember Me ID instead. 

For example, if you have two applications:

1. Application 1 offered by Company ABC
2. Application 2 offered by the same Company ABC
That share will contain the **same** Company ABC ID and a **different** ID for application 2. Yoti has no access to these IDs. This approach is in line with Yoti’s data minimisation principle, meaning users should only share the details relevant to what you are doing.

{% callout type="info" title="Good to know" %}
If a user deletes the Digital ID app without taking a backup, it will generate a new remember me ID when their Digital ID account is set-up.
{% /callout %}

## Address attributes

Yoti has two options to show clients addresses:

1) Full address:- the address as a string.

2) Structured address:- a broken down version of an address.

There is a small explanation of each attribute and what the content type is.

{% table %}
| Name | Expected content type | Explanation | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| building_number | STRING | The number of the building. | 
| building_name | STRING | The name of the building. | 
| sub_building_name | STRING | The subtitle of the building. | 
| address_line_1 | STRING | The first line of the address. |

{% /table %}

The below defines the fields of a JSON structure that can be used to define any address. A subset of fields will be present in each case and address_format can be used to ascertain which ones for any given address. The country iso should not be used for this purpose.
