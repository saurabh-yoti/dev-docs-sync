## Yoti's Encryption standards

### Encryption at rest

All data stored on the Yoti platform is encrypted at rest, secured by AES-256 encryption and authenticated by RSA signatures and signed timestamps. 

The Yoti App uses a sophisticated wrapped key model, with the user firmly in control holding a private key on their mobile device, within the secure element, issued during the user on-boarding phase. 

### Encryption in transit

All data exchanged between the Yoti platform and your implementation is encrypted in transit. Yoti uses TLS 1.2 as a minimum baseline, preferring TLS 1.3 where supported.

## Physical and Operational Security

### Accreditations

Yoti holds a SOC 2 Type 2 for our technical and organisational security controls certification. This is audited annually by a top four auditing company. A copy of this report is available upon request, under NDA. 

Yoti also holds an ISO/IEC 27001:2013 information security standard. 

### Data Centres

For the Digital Id service Yoti uses multiple Tier 3 UK data centres. 

### GDPR

With the Digital Id product, Yoti acts as both a data controller and a data processor. 

Yoti has a comprehensive privacy governance framework in place built on the EUâ€™s GDPR requirements, with additional local measures where needed. This is led and overseen by our Data Protection Officer.
