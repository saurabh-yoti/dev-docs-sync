Yoti performs a numerous amount of sub-checks on the document submitted in order to generate this report request:

{% table widths="183" %}
| Recommendation | Explained | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| ðŸŸ   NOT_AVAILABLE | Not enough information to do the requested check. This could be due to text data extraction failing. | 
| ðŸŸ   CONSIDER | If one or more sub check fails. | 
{% /table %}

Each check type will potentially return multiple sub checks in the breakdown reflecting what was requested. In addition each failing sub check will contain additional details on what was flagged:

{% table %}
| Yoti Reason | Description | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| number_of_hits | This is the total number of hits against watchlist types that matches that sub check or any of its subcategories. | 
| closest_match | This is a comma separated list of match_types for the entry that we determined to be the best match for this sub check. | 
{% /table %}
