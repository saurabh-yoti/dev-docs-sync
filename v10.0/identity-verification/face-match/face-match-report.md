Yoti performs an automated initial check to confirm the user's face matches the face on their ID document. If the automated check is not successful, at session creation there is an option to fallback to manual face match whereby the image is reviewed by one of our processing experts. The face match check will give a recommendation based on these as either APPROVE or REJECT.

If an automated AI face match is performed, a pass/fail result is returned, along with a confidence score (between 0 and 1) depending on how successful the match is.
