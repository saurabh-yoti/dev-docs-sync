You can configure what additional personal information you request when a customer gets tested. You can select a mix of attributes from Yoti app and online form for customers to fill in to suit your business needs.

<div class="alert-GTK">

        Good to know
    </div>
    <div class="alert-text">
Customers should provide as little personal information to be able to get tested. That’s why by default, Yoti customers only share their photo and Remember Me ID. Remember me ID is a unique identifier to differentiate between users.
