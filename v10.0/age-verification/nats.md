You will be presented with a section for the Yoti global settings which will allow you to set up the configuration in NATS for all sites. Please visit the [auto$](/age-verification/overview) page for a detailed summary of our available Age Verification methods.

NATS4 exposes a site level setting within the interface, which allows you to configure a different API key for each site. This is shown below. A new API key can be generated through the Yoti Hub, following the same initial set up process. This would be a new 'Age Verification' API key.

Once this is configured, the sites will be enabled with Yoti Age Verification during the signup process.
