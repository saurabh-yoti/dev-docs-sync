The image is analysed by an algorithm that has been trained to determine age by analysing facial features. A robust facial age estimation process should also include liveness detection technology to ensure it’s a real person in front of the camera.

Good for:

- People without ID documents
- Global coverage
- Low friction

## Liveness explained

Our liveness technology looks at the texture, depth and edges of a person’s face and their surroundings for signs of spoofing and requires no movement from the user.
